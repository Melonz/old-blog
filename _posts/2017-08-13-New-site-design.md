# What? What the hell are you talking about?
Oh, right.

We have a main website at <a href="https://melonz.nl">melonz.nl</a>. It's where you can make a Melonz account (soon to be used for things like MelonzClient), and is basically our main hub.

# What did the old one look like?
Well, let's hit up the Wayback Machine and see what we get.

This archive is from June 25, 2017. The "latest news" segment still says "We weren't affected by the CloudBleed bug that was fixed _**last night**_. Yup. Lovely.

# Wow. Okay, what's the new one like?
This.

Miles better, right?

First off, the new Latest News segment actually gets the latest entry from our blog and puts it there. This saves us quite a bit of time.

Secondly, it doesn't use the deprecated ``<center>`` tag in HTML. If you're not a web developer, don't worry about it-

And finally, **it actually displays useful information**!

# Cool!
Hell yeah, it's cool.

# Does that My Account page work now?
It does! About time, right? You can change the following:

- Your username
- Your password
- Your email
- Your profile picture and cover banner

# Conclusion
Thanks for reading! Also, on our blog's <a href="https://github.com/Melonz/melonz.github.io">GitHub</a> page, we now have 100 commits! Yes, we've changed things with the site **100 times**. Thanks to all of you for being on the Road to 100!
