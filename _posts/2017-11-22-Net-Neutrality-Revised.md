As you (most likely) know, the FCC announced its plans to repeal "Obama-era" Net Neutrality rules. They will vote on **December 14th**. Let's see... what's Net Neutrality?

# What's net neutrality?
Net Neutrality prevents cable companies, like Comcast, from controlling what you see and do on the Internet. It also prevents cable companies from introducing "paid prioritization", which means webmasters that don't pay a large fee will become much slower.


Statistics say that a typical Internet user will only wait [up to 3 seconds](https://www.google.com/search?q=website+3+second+rule) for your site to load. This is known as the "3 second rule". In the slow lane, websites will take **much** longer than 3 seconds to load, or they won't load at all, causing smaller websites to break apart.


# What can I do to help?
Via [Battle for the Net's website](https://www.battleforthenet.com/), they are now encouraging you to call your Congressmen directly through their service.

If you're too anti-social to call, you can write an email or a letter to your Congressmen as well.

If you're the polar opposite of anti-social and want to host/attend a protest outside Verizon offices, [see this link](https://events.battleforthenet.com/).

If you don't live in the United States, **spread the word**. [Make it known](#share-post), so that more residents of the US will take action. 

If you own a website, you can also [add the widget to it](https://widget.battleforthenet.com) so that your users are made aware of this major issue.


# I've done all I can.
Great! Continue to fight for Net Neutrality, and hopefully Team Internet will win, like we did last time.
