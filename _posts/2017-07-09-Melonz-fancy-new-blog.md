Hey everyone!


We've made an actual blog! Yes, that means the Medium "blog" we set up won't be used. Instead, come to our nice Jekyll blog (hosted by the lovely people at GitHub!) instead.

# F.A.Q before they're frequently asked
### What's happening to the Medium blog?
As I stated above, as of today, the Medium blog will be discontinued.

### Does that mean you have an RSS feed?
Yup! [Right here.](/feed.xml) Subscribe today, if people still use RSS feeds...

### Will we still get regular updates?
Of course! We'll update you as much as possible on all the happenings at Melonz.

### I want to comment! Where's the comments section?
That's coming soon. For now, send us a tweet ([@MelonzDev](https://twitter.com/melonzdev)) to tell us your thoughts!

Alright, that's all we have for now! Subscribe to the [RSS feed](/feed.xml), and [follow us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/melonzinc) if you want.
