Hi everyone!


As you probably know, the FCC wants to destroy net neutrality. But, you may wonder, what's net neutrality, anyway?

# What's net neutrality?
Net Neutrality prevents cable companies, like Comcast, from controlling what you see and do on the Internet. It also prevents cable companies from introducing "paid prioritization", which means companies that don't pay a large fee will become much slower.


Statistics say that a typical Internet user will only wait [up to 3 seconds](https://www.google.com/search&q=website+3+second+rule) for your site to load. This is known as the "3 second rule". In the slow lane, websites will take **much** longer than 3 seconds to load.


For a small startup like this, Net Neutrality <mark>is crucial to us</mark>. You can read more about it at [battleforthenet.com](https://battleforthenet.com).

# Well, how can I help you guys?
First of all, it's not just us who's going to be affected. <mark>Every single Internet user will be affected.</mark>


Anyway, you can send a message to the FCC and your local Congressman (if you live in the US). You can send it easily and quickly by using [Battle for the Net's site](https://www.battleforthenet.com).


We've already sent our message to the FCC about why we need Net Neutrality, and we encourage you to do the same. Take 10 minutes out of your day, please, to save the Internet.

# OK, I sent that, now what?
You can do more than that, too! Spread the word about Net Neutrality! You can share this blog post, share the link to the Battle for the Net website.


If you own a website, you can write a blog post about it, or even [add the widget to your website](https://widget.battleforthenet.com).


That's all we have for now. If you did everything we recommended, continue the fight. Team Internet won't back down until we save Net Neutrality.
