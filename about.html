        <h1>What's a Melonz?</h1>
		<p>Hi, we're Melonz, a team of computer software developers and PC lovers that works with all sorts of stuff.</p>
		<p>We're using things like <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>, <a href="https://electron.atom.io">Electron</a>, and even <a href="https://unity3d.com">Unity</a>.</p>
		<h1>OK, what are you making?</h1>
		<p>Our two biggest projects are The Matrix Glitch and MelonzClient.</p>
		<h1>What's MelonzClient?</h1>
		<p>MelonzClient is a game client we're developing that loves game devs and our users. Read our <a href="/2016/Melonz-Introducing-MelonzClient-Old.html">really old blog post</a> about it, if you want.</p>
		<h1>Now, what's The Matrix Glitch?</h1>
		<p>As it says <a href="https://melonz.nl/tmg/">on the TMG website</a>, The Matrix Glitch is a game about saving your world from a huge glitch that is causing everything on Earth to disintegrate into nothing. You must figure out the passcode to turn on the world's computer. Read more <a href="https://melonz.nl/tmg">on the site.</a></p>
